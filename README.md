Terraform-Project
🚀 Project Overview
This project showcases Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, enabling automated provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure. It demonstrates best practices for writing modular, reusable Terraform configurations suitable for real-world cloud deployments.

✨ Key Features
Automated Infrastructure Provisioning: Deploy cloud resources seamlessly using Terraform scripts.

Modular Code Structure: Reusable modules for scalable and maintainable infrastructure.

State Management: Configured backend support for secure and consistent state handling.

Multi-Cloud Ready: Compatible with major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Example Resources: Practical examples of resource creation and lifecycle management.

🛠️ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:

Terraform installed (version 0.12 or higher recommended)

An active cloud provider account (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)

Basic understanding of Terraform commands and syntax

Git installed on your local machine

⚙️ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and deploy the infrastructure:

bash
terraform plan
Apply the configuration to provision resources:

bash
terraform apply
💡 Usage Tips
Customize the Terraform variables and modules to fit your specific cloud environment.

Securely manage your Terraform state files, especially when working in teams.

Use version control to track changes in your infrastructure code.

Regularly update Terraform and provider plugins for best compatibility.
